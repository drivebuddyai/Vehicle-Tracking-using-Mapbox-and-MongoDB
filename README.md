# Vehicle-Tracking-using-Mapbox-and-MongoDB

Build a Single Page Application Using React, Redux and mapbox for live tracking of vehicles

Pre-requisites

1. mapbox access token (developers can get this from mapbox website mapbox.com)
2. GPS Data

Business Requirements

1. User should be able to see list of vehicles on a left hand side and should be able to select one of them from their tracking perspective
2. Upon selecting one of the vehicles, mapbox should be able to show vehicle icon or a marker on map with current location
3. After every 10 sec this marker needs to be able to move based on updated GPS location on map for selected vehicle. Marker or vehicle icon should be moved smoothly on a map to new GPS location

Expectations

1. Component driven React Redux based develoment
2. UI, UX Aspects considering basic navigation and component development
3. JSON based GPS Data storage instead of REST APIs. GPS Data is provided for this POC. Still if you wish to leverage any 3rd party APIs who provide real time GPS data, you can use them
4. git repo link for above project once completed

Timeline: 2 days
